Was it your first time writing a unit test, using a particular framework, etc?
===============================================================================

I always write unit and functional test using phpunit. Even that I don't use TDD, sometimes I do it because it helps
to progress in complex developments otherwise I write tests just before to ask for merge request and I always trying to
find defects, not only the happay path.

The prototype has been developed using Symfony components because I more familiar.


What would you have done differently if you had had more time
=============================================================

If I would have had more time I would have implemented a Docker composer to include a MySQL DB an test in
a more realistic environment.
I would have tried performance tests
I would implemented a log system
I would have included some documentation for developers explaining how to include new providers, sources, etc.
